Getting Started
===============


TelemetryUI is split into four different sections:

- **Core modules** (Which makeup the functionality and must be imported in any project using TUI)

- **Base modules** (Which makeup the base actions of menus such as the ability to run functions, change parameters and more)

- **Decorated modules** (Which are base modules with extra **flair**)

- **Wrapped modules** (Which are ways to wrap other modules into things like columns and more)
