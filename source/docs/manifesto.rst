Manifesto
=========

Our team aims to develop "meta changing" software for FTC. Through our team of four programmers, we aim to change the way we interface with robots, and to reduce the amount of time teams spend coding.

Our two libraries are only the beginning, as we're actively developing extensions to DAB involving creating computationally cheap movement / pathfinding algorithms, building higher capabilities within dabscript, and more.
