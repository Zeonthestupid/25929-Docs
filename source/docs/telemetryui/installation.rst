Installation
============

As of now, we are using Jitpack and github packages as our package hosting. We will (in the future) host both this and our other libraries on mavenCentral.



Our jitpack `Package`_ is generally more recommended.

.. _Package : https://jitpack.io/#Zeonthestupid/telemetryui

Or, if you'd rather, you can clone the `repo`_ directly into your project folder!

.. _repo : https://github.com/Zeonthestupid/telemetryui/
