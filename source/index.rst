25929 documentation
===================
Welcome to our teams public documentation. Here you'll find all of our software. We're currently developing two main things:

- Telemetry UI which hijacks the telemetry system allowing you to build interactive menus that can run functions, change parameters and more!
- DAB (Driver Autonomous Builder), which allows you to build an autonomous by running an opMode, or coding an an XML based language called DABSCRIPT

Our team aims to make *meta changing* software, changing how we interface with robots in FTC.
